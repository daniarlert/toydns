# ToyDNS

ToyDNS is an implementation of Julia Evan's DNS in a weekend, which consists on a basic DNS resolver writen in Python.

## About
ToyDNS is a project born out of my desire to solidify the DNS concepts I've been acquiring throughout my years pursuing a Computer Science degree. Through the development of this fundamental DNS resolver in Python, I've had the opportunity to enhance my comprehension of the inner workings of DNS.
